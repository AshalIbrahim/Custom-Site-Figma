# Custom-Site-Figma
Hello everyone,

I’m excited to present a new coffee shop UI design prototype created using Figma. This design is inspired by Gloria Jean's and focuses on combining aesthetic appeal with user-friendly interactions. Here’s a quick overview:

Key Features:
Hover Effects: Smooth transitions enhance the user experience. Hover over product images to see text descriptions reappear, providing more information about each coffee.
Engaging Layout: A clean and modern layout with visually appealing images draws users in, making it easy to explore our coffee options.
Product Highlights: Featured best-sellers like Blueberry Sunrise Coffee, Double Espresso, and Rose Flavoured Coffee, each with descriptive text and pricing.
Menu Sections: Dedicated sections for hot and cold beverages, encouraging users to explore more with “View More” buttons.
Prototyping Details:
This project showcases the power of Figma’s prototyping capabilities, particularly with hover interactions and dynamic text appearances. These features are designed to make the browsing experience interactive and enjoyable.
